Q: What is this warning all about?
</p>
<p>
A: On 16 October 2018 developers of this game released a mandatory update that made its interface lag for several seconds on every screen transition on some devices. They were immediately notified of this bug and promised to fix it soonâ„¢. An optimized client was released on 22 October 2019. It fixed several things while breaking some others.
